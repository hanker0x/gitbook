# Suggest Chain

_Warning: This is an experimental feature._

Coin98's 'suggest chain' feature allows front-ends to request adding new Cosmos-SDK based blockchains that isn't natively integrated to Coin98 extension.\
If the same chain is already added to Coin98, nothing will happen. If the user rejects the request, an error will be thrown.

This allows all Cosmos-SDK blockchains to have permissionless, instant wallet and transaction signing support for front-ends.

Coin98 supports the basic the `x/bank` module's send feature and balance query. Also, it is able to show the staking reward percentage from the `supply` and `mint` module. (For Stargate chains, Coin98 will find the supply through the `bank` module).
