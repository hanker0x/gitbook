3. &#x20;**Use of Services**

**3.1. Wallets**

**3.1.1. Wallet Creation and Import**

Coin98 provides users with access to an interface allowing you to execute instructions directly on multiple blockchain networks (“**Supported Blockchain Networks**”). The Wallet also allows users to manage multisource and multichain Digital Assets that are compatible with the Wallet (“**Supported Digital Assets**”) by creating many different “wallets”, initiating transfers and transactions involving Digital Assets.

The creation and use of the Wallet by signing up with your social account, including but not limited to Google, Facebook account shall be governed by terms and conditions of Ramper wallet [here](https://docs.ramper.xyz/ramper-wallet/terms-of-service).

Coin98 also allows users to import their existing wallets, regardless of smart contract wallet or hardware wallet into the Coin98 Software for more easy access to our Services.

**3.1.2. Zen Card Creation and Use on Coin98 Software**

These Terms shall apply to the use of the certain volume of the services attached to Zen Card Wallet, an NFC hybrid wallet offering enhanced security and convenience created and held by users on Coin98 Software.

Unlike traditional decentralized wallets, Zen Card Wallet offers users a tool to conveniently and securely sign transactions. With unique security technology, by which Zen Card holders hold a key share (“**Card Key Share**”) to sign transactions, while the other share is on the User’s mobile device (“**Device Key Share**”). Only when both shares interact, a transaction can take place. This means that only you are able to initiate the transaction or access your Digital Assets. For clarity, each Zen Card can only be integrated with only one Wallet. For avoidance of doubt, the physical Zen Card is provided by an independent supplier and your purchase of the physical Zen Card shall be governed by the purchasing terms and conditions of Zen Card’s supplier.

**3.1.3. Your use of the Wallets**

Coin98 does not control any of your account passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), wallet private keys, passphrases for your blockchain Wallets as well as any other codes that you deploy to have access to the Services provided by Coin98. It is your responsibility to keep safe and guard any of your account passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), wallet private keys, passphrases as well as any other codes that you deploy to have access to the Services provided by Coin98. You take full responsibility for keeping your own security information confidential. If you employ a third organization to store your private key(s), whether or not such appointments are made through the Services (e.g., through a key recovery service), Coin98 is not responsible for the actions or omissions of such a third party.

You are solely responsible to protect access to your Wallets by minimally, but not limited to, patching your device’s operating system with regular security and software updates by the legitimate and authorized operating system provider, installing and maintaining latest anti-virus software on the device(s) used, where applicable and use strong password for Wallet.

**3.1.4. Other Services**

The Wallet can be used as an authenticating account to access current and potentially other services and/or products offered via Coin98 Software, including without limitation to access to third-party applications integrated into Coin98 Software (collectively "**Third-Party Integrated Applications**") and to the following decentralized services:&#x20;

(i) **Cross-chain Bridges**: named as SpaceGate on Coin98 Software. SpaceGate is a cutting-edge cross-chain bridge that enables seamless asset transfers across diverse blockchain networks.

(ii) **Coin98 Vault**: Coin98 Vault allows users to fully control how they spend and split the assets by assigning the permissions to specific Addresses at a determined schedule. This feature is a useful and fee-saving tool for a team leader to distribute funds to their members or a project owner to arrange tokens for investors/ users according to their plans and the beneficiary can now simply track and manage all of their token claim/payment schedules thanks to this feature.

(iii) **Staking**: a simple and secure way for users to earn passive income through single-asset staking, by locking user’s Digital Assets as featured on Coin98 Software from time to time following the rules as set out for the Staking service at the time of stake.

**3.3. Interaction with Protocols**

Coin98 Software serves as an aggregator for your interaction with supported decentralized protocols (“Protocols”), including but not limited to, swaps, liquidity, lending protocols which are featured on the Coin98 Software interface from time to time, and provides users the graphic user interface and functionality to technically interact with Protocols. All transaction and/or order matching, clearing, settlement and filing happen in a completely decentralized fashion through the Protocol operated at the peer-to-peer model. We may create or launch Protocols or decentralized liquidity pools, provided that as soon as they are launched, they will not be operated or controlled by us, rather they will be fully decentralized.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that we do not execute the exchange of Digital Assets, cryptocurrencies and tokens, either directly or through Protocols. We do not define, suggest and execute any control over the price of Digital Assets accessible via Protocols. You do not interact with us when you perform swaps or interact with liquidity pools when you stake, rather you interact with a Protocol directly. We do not own or control the underlying software which governs the operation of Protocols, even technically supported by the Coin98 Software or created by us.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have no liability to any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any actions or transactions that you engage in while interacting with Protocols through the Coin98 Software.

You acknowledge that the functionality of Protocols is experimental in nature. We make no representations or warranties of any kind regarding these third-party applications, including but not limited to representations and warranties of compliance, availability, or security. We make no representations or warranties that Protocols are compliant with laws of any jurisdiction, and you are solely responsible for making any such determination with respect to your interaction with such Protocols.

Your interaction with Protocols can be subject to or can incur fees, including fees of such Protocols or Liquidity Providers, or application of interest rates by Protocols.

Please note that the graphic user interface to technically supported Protocols accessible via the Coin98 Software is only the one of user interfaces to access such Protocols. Please note as well that we are a separate entity from, not an affiliate of, and have no control or management over named Protocols.

**3.4. Interaction with Blockchains**

Coin98 Software provides its users with the graphic user interface and functionality to technically interact with various Supported Blockchains Networks. Coin98 Software allows users to retrieve information on Digital Assets and their markets, technically interact with such Supported Blockchain Networks through the provided graphical user interface, including, but not limited to, interact with blockchains for transfer of Digital Assets or submitting any information to Supported Blockchains Networks.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that you interact directly with the corresponding Supporting Blockchain Networks, we do not control your interaction with such Supporting Blockchain Networks and do not process or transmit any information, data or transactions entered by you. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have no liability to any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any actions or transactions that you make or engage in while interacting with Supported Blockchains Networks through the Coin98 Software.

Please note that the graphic user interface to technically Supported Blockchains Networks accessible via the Coin98 Software is only the one of user interfaces to access such Supported Blockchains Networks as well as you can interact with such Supported Blockchain Networks directly through its code without using any third-party graphic user interface. Please note as well that we are a separate entity from, not an affiliate of, and have no control or management over named Supported Blockchains Networks.

We reserve the right to cancel or refuse your interaction with any Supported Blockchain Networks or the accessibility of total interaction functionality to you due to requirements of any applicable Laws or regulations, and without prior notice to you.

4. **Use of the Services**

Your Wallets, Digital Assets, and virtual currencies are completely in your own control. You are the one and only one responsible for manipulating your fund to perform any transfers of Digital Assets. We cannot interfere with any of your Digital Assets storage and transactions from your Wallets in any case. For clarity, transactions you make through Coin98 Software are intended for and may only be used with supported Digital Assets on Supported Blockchain Networks only. Among other things, the Services may not function correctly when used with other unsupported Digital Assets or Blockchain. Coin98 shall have no liability to you for any loss, damage or interruption caused by your attempt to use the Service for other Digital Assets.

The supported Digital Assets may be programmed using smart contracts to have certain in-built rules or conditions that will be automatically executed when such rules or conditions are met. The rules or conditions may be notified to you within the interface of Coin98 Software, however it is your responsibility to fulfill the conditions embedded therein in order to use or transact such supported Digital Assets. Coin98 will not be liable for any loss, damage, or interruptions caused by your failure to meet the rules or conditions of such Supported Digital Assets.

Coin98 does not maintain any Wallets (either single-chain or multi-chain like), and it does not act as a custodian of user’s Digital Assets even if any such Wallet was created via the Coin98 Software. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Coin98 has no liability for or control over the safety, suitability, quality, delivery, legality or other aspects of any of your Digital Assets.

You acknowledge that the transfer of a Supported Digital Assets cannot be canceled, reversed or refunded once it has been broadcast to the relevant blockchain, although it may be in a pending status, and designated accordingly, while the transfer is processed by network operators. Coin98 will not have any responsibility or liability if you have instructed a message to send Digital Assets via Coin98 Software to an Address that is incorrect, improperly formatted, erroneous or intended for a different type of Digital Asset, or to which Coin98 has informed you not to send the unsupported Digital Assets.

Coin98 does not control any blockchain or the relevant Protocol and makes no guarantee that a transfer of Supported Digital Assets will be confirmed by a relevant Protocol. Coin98 may refuse to process or cancel any transaction as required by law or any court or other authority to which Coin98 is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, an amount of time after completion of a transfer of Digital Assets may be required before your next use of our further Services and/or before you engage in any transaction beyond certain volume limits.

If you attempt to transfer to and from your Wallet any Digital Assets that are not the Supported Digital Assets, such Digital Assets may be permanently lost. Coin98 will not be responsible if you lose Digital Assets due to any such attempted transfer or due to your transfer of unsupported Digital Assets, unsupported blockchain networks or other Digital Assets to an incorrect address.

If you attempt to use the Services for any Digital Assets other than the Supported Digital Assets on any networks other than the Supported Blockchain Network in violation of these Terms, you are solely responsible for the payment of any applicable network fees associated with the applicable Digital Assets. If you do not have sufficient Digital Assets to pay such fees, you may not be able to complete any transactions using such other Digital Assets. Coin98 shall have no liability to you for your use of the Wallet in violation of these Terms.

Coin98 does not own or control the supported Protocols which govern the operations of the Supported Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that (a) the Services and the Supported Digital Assets are subject to changes in supported Protocol rules; (b) Coin98 is not responsible for operation of the supported Protocols and that Coin98 makes no guarantee of their functionality, security or availability; (c) Coin98 may suspend or disable the Services in the event of such change; and (d) Coin98 may decide not to support the new changed Protocols entirely or may configure the Services to enable you to transfer the affected Supported Digital Assets.

Coin98 may provide you with the functionality of interacting with Protocols that support or allow Staking based on criteria and according to conditions specified by these Protocols. Staking Protocols may provide functionality of aggregating or routing of the Staked Digital Assets when such Staked Digital Assets may be automatically routed by a staking Protocol for generating additional yield. All calculation and distribution of any applicable Rewards (As defined in Section 7 herein) happen in a complete decentralized fashion through the Protocol operated at the peer-to-peer model according to the initial parameters set at the moment of creation of the Protocol or any related decentralized Staking pool (“**Staking Pool**”).

We may create or launch Protocols or Staking Pools, provided that as soon as they are launched, they will not be operated or controlled by us, rather they will be decentralized. We may monitor any Staking Pool created by us in order to determine if you are eligible for any privileged access announced by us.

You do not interact with us when you perform Staking, rather you interact with a Protocol directly. We do not own or control the underlying software which governs the operation of Protocols, even technically supported by the Coin98 Software or created by us. Coin98 does not and will not be responsible or liable to you for the distribution of any Staking Rewards. Also, Coin98 does not and will not be responsible or liable to you for the provision of any benefits unless specifically promised by Coin98.

By performing Staking you will be unable to access your Staked Digital Assets unless you unstake them. In some instances, you may be unable to unstake Digital Assets before the specified period of time or the specified event, or such unstaking can incur any additional costs to you and/or loss of Staking Rewards.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have no liability to any claims or damages that may arise as a result of your Staking and interaction with Staking Pools through the Coin98 Software.

Your Staking can be subject to or can incur fees, including fees of Protocols, Staking Pools, transaction fees of blockchains.

We do not represent and warrant that we will technically support any Protocols or Staking Pools even technically supported before, notwithstanding if you perform Staking or not. We do not guarantee that you will be able to interact with any Protocols or Staking Pools through the Coin98 Software in future, including that you will be able to unstake your Digital Assets through the graphic user interface of the Coin98 Software.

You agree that Coin98 reserves the right to impose limits, restrictions and/or further conditions to your access to and use of the Services. You further agree that Coin98 reserves the rights, as it deems necessary, among others, to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including availability of any feature without notice and without liability.

You further agree that (a) Coin98 is not responsible for the regulatory status or treatment in any jurisdiction of any Supported Digital Assets that you may access or transact using the Services; (b) you alone are responsible for any transactions that you engage (whether or not authorized by you); and (c) Coin98 or any third party partner may refuse, limit, condition, or suspend any support for any Supported Digital Token if Coin98 or any third party partner is required to do so under law or under the direction of a regulatory authority.

5. **Fees**

Interacting with the Protocol and/or Services may require that you pay a fee, such as network fees and other charges needed to perform a transaction (“**Fee**”). You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or “gas” to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. The Fee for a specific transaction will be displayed to you in the Coin98 Software during the initiation of a transaction and must be accepted before executing such a transaction. We reserve the right to change those Fees at our discretion. Fees applicable to the Services or any component of the Services, if any, shall be set forth or displayed in the Coin98 Software from time to time. By using Coin98 Software or the Services, you hereby consent to such Fees being debited from either or a combination of both of the source Digital Assets or destination Digital Assets applicable to your relevant transaction at the time such transaction is processed. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set transaction Fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Wallet Address. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not have access to your or anyone else’s transactions.

6. **Taxes**

The use of Services shall be exclusive of all taxes that are applicable to, arising from, or in connection to your use of the Services, including your receipt and holding of Digital Assets in any jurisdiction (any such taxes, a “**Payable Tax**”).

You shall be responsible for determining any Payable Tax and declaring, withholding, collecting, reporting and remitting the correct amount of Payable Tax to the appropriate tax authorities. You shall be solely liable for all losses, penalties, claims, fines, punishments, or other liabilities arising from the non-fulfilment or non-performance to any extent of any of your obligations in relation to the Payable Tax. Coin98 shall not be responsible for, or responsible for determining, any Payable Tax attributable to you or declaring, withholding, collecting, reporting or remitting the correct amount of Payable Tax to any Governmental Authority.

7. **Rewards**

In connection with your historic or current use of the Staking, we may provide you certain incentives or rewards on behalf of the blockchain network for completing certain activities, such as completing a certain number of transactions ("**Rewards**"). Details regarding the criteria for earning Rewards will be described within the applicable Service. Upon satisfaction of the criteria for obtaining Rewards and subject to your compliance with the associated rewards terms, these Terms, and the applicable Laws - to be determined exclusively by Coin98 - we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly transfer the earned Rewards to the Wallet that you designate or have connected to the applicable Service. We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue or cancel any Rewards programs at any time and without notice to you.

You acknowledge that (i) such Rewards may be issued in the same denomination as the Digital Assets, (ii) any estimates or projections of Rewards, as applicable, are not a guarantee, (iii) we will never ask for and you should never provide to us the private key for your Wallet, (iv) we are not responsible for the loss of your private key or your inability to access (A) your Wallet, or (B) any resulting Rewards that may be stored therein, and (v) you assume responsibility for ensuring we have the correct and valid address of your Wallet(s). You specifically acknowledge and understand that your Rewards may be subject to a bonding period by Smart Contract that may render your Rewards and/or Digital Assets unavailable and/or subject to other restrictions imposed and controlled by such Smart Contract.

8. **Information accessible via Coin98 Software**

20. **Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration**

We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Coin98, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@coin98.finance. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Coin98 and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

(a) No Representative Actions. You and Coin98 agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, or our Services is personal to you and Coin98 and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

(b) Arbitration of Disputes. Except for claims disputes in which you or Coin98 seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and Coin98 waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “**Disputes**”) resolved in court. All Disputes shall be submitted to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“**SIAC**”) to be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted virtually. You and Coin98 agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the SIAC Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“**SIAC Rules**”). The most recent version of the SIAC Rules is incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the SIAC Rules or waive your opportunity to read the SIAC Rules and waive any claim that the SIAC Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(c) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Coin98, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

(d) Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Coin98 will not have the right to assert the claim.

(e) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall stay pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.

21. **Governing Law**

These Terms and your access to and use of the Services shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

22. **Termination**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time in connection with any transaction as required by applicable law, any Governmental Authority, or if we in our sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating these Terms or the terms of any third-party Services provider at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Such suspension or termination shall not constitute a breach of these Terms by Coin98. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose reasonable limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Services. Such limitations may include where good cause exists, rejecting transaction requests, freezing funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Services.

You may cease access to Coin98 Software and use the Services at any time. You acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such an event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us or any third party, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of the Services, the following Sections will survive: 1, 2, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

23. **Severability**

If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.

24. **Injunctive Relief**

You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Coin98 for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and Coin98 shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.

25. **Miscellaneous**

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Coin98 relating to your access to Coin98 Software and use of the Service. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Coin98, and Coin98’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.

Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
