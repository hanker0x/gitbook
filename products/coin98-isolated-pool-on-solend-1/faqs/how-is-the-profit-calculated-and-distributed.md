# How is the profit calculated and distributed?

Total profit (Net APY) will include the supply APY in their deposit token and C98 rewards. The profit will be calculated in real-time. Each token has a different set of Parameters that determines their actual yields at different points, and can be seen here.&#x20;

Users can withdraw their funds together with the supply APY anytime. But the external rewards in C98 will only be claimable at 0:00 UTC on the 3rd of every month.&#x20;
