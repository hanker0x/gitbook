After providing the amount of C98, I will be able to borrow other tokens from the C98 pool.&#x20;

## Via Coin98 DApp Browser

**Step 1:** Choose the asset you want to borrow. In this article, I will take C98 as an example.

**Step 2:** Enter the amount you want to borrow. Then carefully read the information below before deciding to trade:

* **Borrow limit:** The maximum value of assets you can borrow.
* **Utilization:** Represents how much of your borrow limit.
* **Borrow APY:** The borrow interest rate you have to pay for the protocol.
* **Borrow fee:** Borrow fee by this asset

**Step 3:** Click **Borrow.** The system will charge a very small network fee for this transaction, if you agree, click **Approve.**&#x20;

**Note:**&#x20;

* You can check your assets in the **Dashboard â†’ Show account** section. Please always pay attention to **the Borrow limit** and **the Liquidation threshold** to avoid your loan being liquidated.
* **Liquidation threshold** is the maximum value of your borrow balance before your account will be eligible for liquidation. This is a costly event and should be avoided by lowering your borrow utilization.
* **Borrow utilization** represents how much of your borrow limit is currently being borrowed. At 100%, you are no longer able to borrow.
