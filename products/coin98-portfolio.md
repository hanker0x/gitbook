# Coin98 Portfolio

## What is Coin98 Portfolio?

Knowing where coins are kept, how they perform, and their real-time status are no longer challenges to users, even for DeFi newbies. Coin98 Portfolio is a pure crypto portfolio tracking product by Coin98 Labs, allowing users to monitor portfolios and price changes any time of the day, track and manage the growth of their assets with multi-chain wallet addresses.

## Outstanding features of Coin98 Portfolio

### Track and manage multi-chain wallet addresses

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely difficult to track and trace in one place due to the decentralized nature of each blockchain. A good portfolio tracker should be an on-chain tracking tool for all of your multi-chain coins/tokens performance. This will allow users to keep track of all the coins they want without working with multiple explorer browsers or portfolio trackers.

Coin98 Portfolio - a one-stop tracker for all your coins/ tokens, has supported users to track their portfolio, monitoring price changes and the growth of their assets on 10+ top-tier blockchain addresses, including Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, HECO Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, Tron, TomoChain, Near, Polkadot, Kusama, and Celo easily and conveniently. Coin98 Portfolio is constantly seeking new integrations to stay on the cutting edge of DeFi. You will never worry about tracking your small and micro caps. If it is out there, we have it.

With just one address, the system will automatically detect and suggest the corresponding chain. If it is a multi-chain address, there will be suggestions on which chain you should select. Coin98 Portfolio also supports saving the recent addresses to make it easier for users to manage their assets.

### Stay up-to-date with real-time data

Each crypto asset has its own value, which can fluctuate drastically with little notice. Because cryptocurrency markets operate around the clock, the value of your coins/tokens may change any minute. Users with no prior experience may find it difficult to keep track of their assets' value.

Coin98 Portfolio enables users to view all assets and see how the value of the portfolio changes via the performance chart. We automatically and continuously synchronize users’ real-time crypto balances and transactions.

Users can quickly access the advanced real-time charting so users can go beyond the market cap rankings with integrated market charts, automatically updated gas-gwei coupled with sending/receiving history on the selected chains/ tokens.

### Ensure safety and security

Blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which do not rely on central authorities, allow users to keep control of their own assets. Therefore, the public and private keys are at the heart of your portfolio. Without further additional protection, if someone obtains your private key, they will be able to transfer the whole content of your wallet to a new address. This emphasizes the need of selecting a portfolio tracking tool that prioritizes security.

Except for keeping the users’ wallet addresses, Coin98 Portfolio does not require, track or sell any personal information, Private Key/ Passphrase, or bank account, making it a great option to protect your tokens/coins and your money. Users only need to insert the wallet addresses they want to track, no need for Passphrases and Private Keys.

Coin98 Portfolio's "Hide balance" feature which is designed to improve asset security can keep your assets safe by preventing prying eyes (or intruders) from knowing how much your account holds. You can hide your balance by tapping the "Eye"' button on the portfolio dashboard. users’ balance can, likewise, be swiftly revealed by tapping the "Eye" button again.

### Enhanced UX/UI

The purpose of tracking a portfolio is to be able to quickly view all of the assets and see how their value fluctuates. A good portfolio tracker will show users the total value of their portfolio on the all-in-one page or within 1 or 2 clicks.

Coin98 Portfolio's UX/UI design is impeccable, with a simple, fast and intuitive all-in-one interface. In addition, we also offer an attractive “dark mode” to users, with visual limitations as well as low-level lighting. This will save users' time, prevent unwanted stress and eye strain when using our portfolio tracker.

Besides, Coin98 Portfolio also integrates the Swap button to help users instantly exchange one crypto to another directly on the Portfolio interface in a matter of minutes. Users can swap tokens natively on 6 AMMs built on 5 different blockchains in a trustworthy, permissionless, and seamless manner without switching networks.

### Gain insights and keep track of Whales’ or Top-holders’ wallets

Most crypto investors utilize dedicated portfolio trackers just for monitoring their assets. Only a few people are aware that Coin98 Portfolio can also provide users the same wealth data from Whales’ or Top Holders' wallets with the same variety of information.

With Coin98 Portfolio, users can now absorb more useful information/ data from the portfolio performance of top holders/ whales' wallets and get suggestions to improve performance or to forecast the market trend/ fluctuation within the selected chains.
