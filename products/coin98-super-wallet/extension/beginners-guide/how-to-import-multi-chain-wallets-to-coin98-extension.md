## **Notes**

1\) Coin98 supports 2 import options (New Standard or Old Standard) for each wallet on some blockchains such as Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche C-chain, Viction (formerly Tomochain), Celo, Injective, The Open Network, Tron, Persistence and Aptos (including Aptos Testnet, Aptos Devnet and Aptos mainnet).

2\) The default standard on Coin98 upon creating a new wallet/importing an existing wallet is the new one. If you wish to restore using the old standard, you can select it in the advanced options.

#### a. Non-EVM blockchains:

**Bitcoin Wallet**

* **Legacy Address:** Start the address range with the number “1”, eg 1A1Zc0dA…, commonly supported by exchanges.
* **Bech32 Address:** Start the address range with “bc1”, for example, bc1zahd…, usually supported by non-custodial crypto wallets like Trust Wallet,... From Coin98 Super Wallet version 10.2, the address Bech32 wallet has been improved by Coin98 Super Wallet, unchanged after each transaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
Coin98 encourages users to use the Bech32 wallet to enjoy cheaper transaction costs and faster transaction speed than the Legacy wallet.
{% endhint %}

**Solana Wallet**

* **New Standard** is an import option if you have created a new standard wallet on Coin98 before. It's also an innovative option of Coin98 that allows users to restore **Phantom/Sollet** wallets while keeping the old wallet address format.
* **Old Standard** is an import option for wallets created on Coin98's old versions. If you have used the New Standard, you can ignore this standard.

**Injective, The Open Network, Tron Wallet, Persistence, and Aptos Wallet**

* **New Standard** is an import option if you have created a new standard wallet on Coin98 before.
* **Old Standard** is an import option for old standard wallets created on Coin98 Super Wallet. If you have used the new standard, you can ignore this standard.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, these standards for Tron and Aptos are available for Coin98 Super Wallet and will be available on Coin98 Extension soon.
{% endhint %}

#### **b. EVM Blockchains**

**Celo, Avalanche (C-Chain), Viction (EVM blockchains)**

* **New Standard** is the import option if you have created a new standard wallet on the Coin98 Super Wallet before. In this standard, EVM's addresses will have the same wallet address as the Ethereum wallet.
* **Old Standard** is an import option for old standard wallets created on the Coin98 Super Wa. If you have used the new standard, you can ignore this standard.

3\) After having been successfully restored, your wallet will immediately appear on the main screen. You can also access the **Manage Wallet** section to view and manage all of your created/restored wallets on Coin98 Super Wallet/ Coin98 Extension.
