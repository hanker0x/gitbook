# How to Override Wallet

When users install various wallet extensions into the same browser, there will be some cases such as: override wallet situations; connected directly wallet in default (Metamask instead Coin98 Wallet); or etc. We recognize the annoying situations for our users; therefore, we are improving the feature **Override Wallet** (on/off button) to let users control their preference toward which Extension they want to interact with.

**Step 1:** Install Coin98 Extension (already having Metamask, Binance Wallet, Keplr, etc);

**Step 2**: Navigate to **Settings**;

**Step 3**: Select **Override Wallets**.

_In term of turning off those wallets, you allow other Extensions to override Coin98 Extension._
