# How to store NFTs on Coin98 Extension Wallet

Users can now store, send, and receive many standards of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With the rapid growth of NFTs, Coin98 aims to provide users with a one-of-a-kind DeFi experience and opens the door for all users to enter the NFT/ GameFI sector with ease.

**To switch to the NFT storing tab, please follow the following steps:**

After opening Coin98 Extension, at the home screen, select the NFTs tab in the upper navigation bar.

If you have already owned an NFT or imported a wallet from another application, your NFT will be fully displayed in this interface.

Your own NFTs will be stored and classified by each supported project. Users can check the number of holdings and see the detailed information of each type of NFT when clicking on the project's logo.
