# How to add Custom Network on Coin98 Super Wallet

{% hint style="info" %}
Please check carefully before receiving any assets on the unsupported networks:

* Coin98 only supports displaying the father token on unsupported networks.
* Coin98 does not yet support adding tokens on unsupported networks, which leads to the fact the unsupported tokens will not be displayed on your app.
{% endhint %}

The Custom Network feature allows users to add a specific blockchain which is not supported by default in the Coin98 Super Wallet (typically Testnet).

> The added Custom Network will be available in the blockchain list when you add or import a wallet.Comment
