# How to create a send request for someone

You can send a transfer request in the following section:

* Directly Request Send from More section
* Chat section in Private Messages between OneID holders who already log in to OneID on the App

To use the “Request Send" feature, the recipient needs to first link their OneID to the wallet.

2. &#x20;Once the sender declines your transfer request or sends your token to you, the status will update you:

* Received: You already received the token successfully from the sender\
