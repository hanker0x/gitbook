### What is Coin98 Staking? <a href="#section-0" id="section-0"></a>

Coin98 Staking is the latest release of the Coin98 Labs to fulfill our product suite and reward for C98 holders. It will also be a simple and secure way for users to earn passive income while involved in the Ninety Eight Ecosystem.&#x20;

Coin98 Staking offers fixed interest rates based on your staking plans. There are three different packages with suitable staking periods and amounts of tokens for users to engage.&#x20;

After staking ends, users can unstake and harvest earnings directly to their wallets. Notably, stakers are unable to unstake in the first 15 days. If you unstake before the expiration date, you will only earn a fixed 2.0% floating interest rate, no matter what types of staking plans you chose.

### What do you benefit from Coin98 Staking? <a href="#section-1" id="section-1"></a>

Besides appealing interest rates, Coin98 also offers you exclusive NFT staking cards, real assets for Coin98 stakers.&#x20;

With each staking plan you choose, you will get a unique NFT. There are nine classes of NFT Staking Cards, depending on your staking plan and tier.

We also allow you to personalize their cards by supporting them with customized names and IDs. With each customization for name and ID, you only have to pay 10 C98. We believe that the NFT Staking Card is your unique treasure, and you can show it off with your friends on social media.

The NFT card is also proof of your staking, so when you transfer your NFT card, be aware that you are transferring your staked assets.&#x20;
