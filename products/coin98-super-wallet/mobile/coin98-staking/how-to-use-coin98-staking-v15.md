### Use Case Example

Anderson is planning to stake **10,200 C98** within a 6 months period. He goes to stake.coin98.com and then selects 8% APR. He enters a detailed page and decides to customize his card.

* Name on Card: Anderson Kozlov
* CardID: 9898 0000 0000 0000

Then, he confirms and stakes successfully 10,200 C98(BEP20) with his summary.

* Staking Period: 6 months
* APR: 7.2%
* Claimed Start: 15 days
* Day start: 01/01/2022
* Day end: 30/06/2022
* Stake Amount: 10,200 C98
* Holder Name: 10 C98
* Card ID: 10 C98

The next day, Anderson is about to unstake his packages, but unfortunately, he is unable to unstake his assets based on staking policy (:rotating\_light:**Only after 15 days to unstake**:rotating\_light:). He must wait until after 15 days to unstake his assets. On the 16th day, he could unstake with a float rate (2%) APR. Now he is going to unstake his package with an APR **2**% (\~**8.3835 C98**). Then, 10,200 C98 and the reward - 8.3838 C98 will be in his wallet.
