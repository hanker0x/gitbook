Currently, Coin98 Vault is supporting multiple blockchains: Viction, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, HECO Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, Fantom, Polygon, Celo, Ancient8, Arbitrum, etc. Coin98 Vault also enhances the experience by not limiting the receiving address in a single event.

### Better management of your assets <a href="#section-3" id="section-3"></a>

Coin98 Vault brings asset management to a new level, allowing users to fully control how they spend and split the assets by assigning the permissions to specific addresses at a determined schedule.

In addition, in the context of protocols, the vault plays the role of storing assets, then granting access to 1 or more contracts and can be customized without depending on a fixed contract. Coin98 Vault makes everything much more transparent and flexible.

This feature is a useful and fee-saving tool for a team leader to distribute funds to their members or a project owner to arrange tokens for investors/ users according to their plans. More advanced use cases will be updated in the future.

### Unique “token claim" experience <a href="#section-4" id="section-4"></a>

Users can now simply track and manage all of their token claim/payment schedules thanks to this feature. The countdown makes the waiting time less stressful because not knowing when the thing you’re waiting on will arrive is especially excruciating.

Furthermore, the process for users to claim incentives or get scheduled payments on Coin98 Vault has been refined and streamlined to the fullest, with users receiving tokens with just one click.

### More secured way to store crypto assets <a href="#section-5" id="section-5"></a>

Vaults can store cryptocurrency just like regular wallets. Besides that, Coin98 Vault is built in such a way that its contract is independent of the protocol contract, ensuring that security is always a top priority. In addition, Coin98 Vault was audited by Slow Mist - a popular Blockchain and smart contract audit company. This means users do not have to worry about any individual who may want to access their funds if the protocol eventually gets hacked.

Vaults can also be used among several owners, allowing you to share ownership of the tokens included. Coin98 Super Wallet will include the multi-sig feature in the future, requiring authorization from all owners before anybody can withdraw or take tokens from the vault, offering an additional degree of security.
