# Do I have to backup every time my Wallet updates?

No, you don't. After any updates, your wallet will continuously be backed up. So you can use your wallet as normal.

Coin98 Super Wallet doesn’t change users’ Private key and Seed phrase after updating.

You only need to back up your Private key and Seed phrase once. We recommend that you do this as soon as you create a new wallet.

You can access your wallet at any time as long as you keep your Private key and Seed phrase.
