2. Set up FaceID/Fingerprint: Only displayed on the devices that support these features
3. Authenticate to access the app: Only displayed after FaceID or Fingerprint is set up. The app will automatically require FaceID or Fingerprint upon opening and making any transactions
4. Auto-lock: This setting allows the app to lock after a specified period of inactivity. If the Never option is selected, FaceID or Fingerprint authentication will only be required upon reopening the app after closing it.

* You can remove these settings whenever you want, simply by turning off Set up FaceID or Fingerprint. The app will then require your PIN Code for verification before restoring your settings to the original condition.
