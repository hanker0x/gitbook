# How to create a Multichain Wallet

## Introduction

With the increasing number of public chains, most users prefer to hold multiple digital assets of the public chain at the same time. If each digital asset of a chain is placed in a single-chain wallet for storage and circulation, multiple assets would need to have multiple wallets. It is clearly very cumbersome for users to install and with multiple corresponding single-chain wallets at the same time, so we - **Coin98 Super Wallet,** have developed a multi-chain wallet to help users both hold and interact easily.

## What is a Multi-Chain Wallet?

A Multi-Chain Wallet allows users to keep more than one crypto asset belonging to multiple blockchain networks.

Our latest version supports more than 100 blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, Near, Avalanche, TRON, Polygon, Fantom, Heco Chain, OKExChain, GateChain, KuCoinChain, xDaiChain, Polkadot, Kusama, Cosmos, THORChain, Terra, BandChain, Kava, Persistence, Viction, KardiaChain, Ronin, Celo, Klaytn, Harmony, Optimism, Boba Network, Arbitrum, Arbitrum on xDai, Cronos, PlatON, Moonbeam, Bittorrent, TON, Terra 2.0, etc
