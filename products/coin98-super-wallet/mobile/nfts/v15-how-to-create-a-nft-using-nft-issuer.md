NFT Issuer is one of the newest and most powerful tools integrated into Coin98 Super Wallet. Now the process of creating simple NFTs, such as graphics, and collectible cards, is relatively simple, without requiring users to have extensive knowledge in the field of coding or blockchain technology. Users only need to install Coin98 Super Wallet, prepare the network fee, upload their images, and let Coin98 Super Wallet do the rest.

**Step 2:** Select the wallet address and the network which you wish to issue tokens. The address receiving the issued tokens. The system will automatically fill in the connected wallet address but you can still use another wallet address.

In this example, we chose the Viction (VRC25). Next, select the wallet that will receive the issued NFTs and be responsible for the gas fee payment.

**Step 3:** Click on the Logo icon, and choose the image you want to mint from the library.

**Step 4:** Fill in the following information:

* **Name:** The name of the NFT
* **Description:** The story of the attributes behind the NFTs. Something you want to highlight about your NFT.

If successful, your NFT will display in the NFT tab on the main home screen.

To check your minting history, select the **History** icon, and click on the minted NFT which will redirect you to Block Explorer to view your NFT information.
