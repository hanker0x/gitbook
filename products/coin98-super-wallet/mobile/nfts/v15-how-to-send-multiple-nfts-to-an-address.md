**Note**:

* The gas fee varies depending on the blockchain of the NFT project. You need to ensure you have the appropriate father tokens to cover gas fees in your transfer transactions (e.g., ETH for Ethereum network transfers, SOL for Solana network, etc.). For a clearer understanding of gas fees on different blockchains, refer to this article:  [https://coin98.net/what-is-gas-fee](https://coin98.net/what-is-gas-fee)
* By default, on Coin98 Super Wallet, the gas fee is set at the Standard rate that offers the most optimized speed at a reasonable cost.
