# How to revoke token allowances using Wallet Approval

### **Why should you use the Wallet Approval tool?**

To trade, farm, stake, or interact with any dApps, you are required to allow smart contracts to access your assets. There are 2 approaches to allowance: **Allow for a specific amount of tokens** and **unlimited approval**.

* **Allow for a specific amount of tokens:** you give access to a particular amount of tokens for smart contracts of DApp. It can not exceed the maximum number of tokens that you grant.
* **Unlimited approval:** It means that you provide a smart contract with full permission of your funds.

Unlimited approval brings them a fast and frictionless experience; however, it might potentially affect the risk of asset loss if you interact with untrustworthy platforms or scamming pools.

It is recommended not to grant unlimited access to a platform to keep your funds safe.

**Note:** This revocation process will require a small gas fee. Please ensure you have enough father tokens in your wallet to cover the gas fees for revoking transactions on each blockchain.\
