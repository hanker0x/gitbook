After securing your remaining funds. There's still a task to do, we first need to reassess the cause of this accident and take preventive measures to prevent this from happening in the future.

## First, why did this happen?

The rapid growth and profitability of the cryptocurrency industry have made it a prime target for hackers. No matter how secured your app or your phone, you are just one simple mistake away from being hacked. Kindly check whether:

1. Your computer/ mobile has malicious software which is able to extract private data such as your password(s) file, keyboard input, or clipboard
2. You have visited a phishing website that stole your information
3. You gave your seed phrase to someone, a website, or a scam app
4. You approved unlimited access to your fund for a scam site/ scam smart contract
5. You approved unlimited access for a site/ smart contract, which later was exploited.

## Second, how to prevent it from happening in the future?

1. Always double-check any software before installing it on your device. **Pro tip**: Many people choose to keep a separate phone specifically for cryptocurrency activities. This "crypto phone" is used solely for managing crypto and isn't involved in any other tasks.
2. **Never share your seedphrase with anyone, ever!**
3. Double-check any dApps before interacting with them.
4. You can revoke wallet access after completing transactions using our [Wallet Approval tool](https://docs.coin98.com/products/terminal/wallet-approval).
