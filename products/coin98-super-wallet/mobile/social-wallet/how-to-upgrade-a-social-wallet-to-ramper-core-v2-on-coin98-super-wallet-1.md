# How to upgrade a social wallet to Ramper Core V2 on Coin98 Super Wallet

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Note:**

To ensure uninterrupted access and avoid any losses, please migrate or transfer your Social Wallet assets to the new version before the old version is discontinued on **31/12/2024.**

* **Login via Facebook & Apple**: You'll be prompted to choose between the old version and the new version. Please note that the new version wallet address will differ from the old version address. Therefore, you should manually transfer your assets on the old address to the new address. If you don't do this, you won't be able to access your assets through your social account once the old version stops working. Instead, you'll need the seed phrase of the old version wallet to re-import your wallet into a hot wallet.
* **Login via Google & Email options**: The new version wallet address will remain the same as the old version address.
