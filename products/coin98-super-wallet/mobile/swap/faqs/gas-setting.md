## What is gas setting?

Gas setting is a feature that allows users to adjust the amount of Gas fee (transaction fee) according to their needs.

But first, what is Gas fee?

Gas is a measure for the computing energy required to process and validate a particular transaction on the network. Gas fee can be considered as transaction fee - a payment made by users to complete transactions on blockchains.

* The transaction fee in each blockchain is completely different.
* Before conducting any transactions on any blockchain, make sure that you have the father token of that blockchain to pay for the gas fee.
