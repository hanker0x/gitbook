# What is Transaction Deadline

Transaction deadline is the maximum transaction time that you can specify to avoid the case of long waiting time without any matching orders.&#x20;

For example, on Ethereum, when there are too many transactions that need to be processed or when the market fluctuates strongly, the transaction time difference is huge, from within 30 seconds to 15-20 minutes, or even for a few hours. When the Transaction Deadline is set at 15 minutes, any transactions that exceed this deadline will automatically be canceled.
