# What is inverse rate

**The exchange rate** is also known as the token exchange rate or rate. This is the exchange rate between two currencies/tokens. This is the conversion of the price of one token into another token. Or more specifically, the amount of token needed to buy 1 unit of another token.

**The inverse rate** is the opposite ratio of the exchange rate.

For example,

* Rate \[a]: 1 ETH = 10,674 C98&#x20;
* Inverse rate \[b]: 1 C98 = 0.0001 ETH&#x20;
