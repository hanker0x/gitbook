# How to Create a Zen Card Wallet

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important note**: Please be aware that this process will replace any existing Wallet in the Zen Card with the newly created Wallet because each Zen Card can hold only one wallet. Therefore, make sure you back up the **Seed Phrase** and **Private Key** of the existing wallet in Zen Card in a safe place before creating a new wallet. After being replaced, you can only restore the replaced wallets by **Seed Phrase or Private Key**.
{% endhint %}
