{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Note:**

Please be aware that processes such as creating a new wallet, restoring a wallet, or migrating a wallet to Zen Card will replace any existing Wallet in the Zen Card with the newly created/restored/migrated Wallet because each Zen Card can hold only one wallet. Therefore, make sure you back up the **Seed Phrase and Private Key** of the existing wallet in Zen Card in a safe place before creating/restoring/migrating a wallet. After being replaced, you can only restore the replaced wallets by **Seed Phrase** or **Private Key**.
{% endhint %}

When you add a wallet to a Zen Card that already has wallet data, you’ll see a warning. Please kindly make sure. Please kindly make sure to back up the Seed Phrase and Private Key of the current wallet before proceeding.
