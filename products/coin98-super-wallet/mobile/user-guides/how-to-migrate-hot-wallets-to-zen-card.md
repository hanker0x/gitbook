# Migrate Hot Wallets to Zen Card

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Note**: Please be aware that this process will replace any existing Wallet in the Zen Card with the migrated Wallet because each Zen Card can hold only one wallet. Therefore, make sure you back up the **Seed Phrase** and **Private Key** of the existing wallet in Zen Card in a safe place before migrating a wallet. After being replaced, you can only restore the replaced wallets by **Seed Phrase or Private Key**.
{% endhint %}

1. The area where you tap to scan a card may vary depending on different phone models. It's advisable to look up the appropriate placement for NFC cards on your specific phone.\
   _For iPhones 10 and newer (e.g., iPhone 13, 14, 15), it's recommended to place the card horizontally on the upper half of the front side of the phone._
2. The display for successful scans will differ between Android and iOS devices.
