# How to Redeem Zen Gift

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Note**:&#x20;

* The Zen Card must be pre-configured with data to redeem a Gift, and the Gift can only be redeemed once.
* Please be aware that processes such as creating a new wallet, restoring a wallet, or migrating a wallet to Zen Card will replace any existing Wallet in the Zen Card with the newly created/restored/migrated Wallet because each Zen Card can hold only one wallet. Therefore, make sure you back up the **Seed Phrase and Private Key** of the existing wallet in Zen Card in a safe place before creating/restoring/migrating a wallet. After being replaced, you can only restore the replaced wallets by **Seed Phrase or Private Key.**
