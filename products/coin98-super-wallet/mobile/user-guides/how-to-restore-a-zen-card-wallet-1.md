# How to Restore a Zen Card Wallet

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important Note**: Please be aware that this process will replace any existing Wallet in the Zen Card with the restored Wallet because each Zen Card can hold only one wallet. Therefore, make sure you back up the **Seed Phrase** and **Private Key** of the existing wallet in Zen Card in a safe place before restoring a wallet. After being replaced, you can only restore the replaced wallets by **Seed Phrase or Private Key.**

* You have Coin98 Super Wallet and a hot wallet created
