# How to Use Zen Card

#### Manage Zen Card wallet

Zen Card is managed exactly like Hot Wallets, but you will need to Tap the corresponding Zen Card of the selected Wallet to execute the security actions like showing Seed Phrase or Private Key, transferring assets or interacting with Dapps/DEXs, etc.

**eCard** is an advanced feature of Zen Card using NFC technology. By tapping it on a phone, users can open an online profile in the appâ€™s browser. They can easily create and customize their profile with details like username, name, avatar, phone number, email, oneID, social accounts, custom links, and themes.

It also supports unlimited sharing of business cards across various social media platforms, allowing users to not only display their position and job title but also to present a multi-dimensional view of their story, personality, and style.
