# How to use Seed Phrase Recover Tool

## What is a seed phrase?

A seed phrase is similar to a password. However, the password is created by users, the seed phrase is auto-generated randomly from the standard of wallet generators. Seed Phrase generally tend to be longer and more complex than the average password, which increases overall security. As a result, it is harder to remember 12 random wordings than 12 of your own wordings.

## **Problems with Seed Phrase**

A wallet address is like a house. The seed phrase is the key, and logging in is like walking through the front door. When a user couldn't remember their seed phrase, itâ€™s like losing their keys. There are some ways to store your seed phrase such as seed phrase encryption, written in your notebook, or syncing- cloud. But somehow we miss the last character of the seed phrase.
