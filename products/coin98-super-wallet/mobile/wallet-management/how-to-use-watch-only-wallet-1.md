# How to use Watch-only Wallet

## What is the Watch-only Wallet feature?

A watch-only wallet within Coin98 Super Wallet serves as a read-only representation of a cryptocurrency wallet. It allows you to observe the wallet's balance and transactions without the ability to initiate transactions or access private keys. This feature is often utilized for the purposes of enhanced security and monitoring.

#### Can I withdraw funds from the Watch-only wallet in Coin98 Super Wallet? <a href="#h.fpvq0kug4tf0" id="h.fpvq0kug4tf0"></a>

**-> No**, since the purpose of a watch-only wallet is to exclusively monitor the funds and assets of a wallet. To access the wallet's funds, you must possess the Seed phrase or private key. Once you have the seed phrase or private key, you can restore the wallet in the same manner as a hot wallet.
