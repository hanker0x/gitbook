# FAQ: Why did I recover a wallet but my balance shows 0 and the addresses are changed?

First, if you encounter this situation while using Seed Phrase, try to use Private Key to recover the wallet because one Seed phrase will be able to generate many private keys -> multiple wallet addresses. If this method still does not work, you can refer to the following ways:

### 1. The Seed Phrase/ Private Key wasn't correctly input.

The Seed Phrases/ Private Keys may have missing letters or typos. Check to see if you entered anything incorrectly.&#x20;

### 2. The Seed Phrase/ Private Key was correctly input but in the wrong order.

Please keep in mind that different seed phrase orders will result in different wallets. Make sure the seed phrase is entered in the correct order.

### 3. The seed phrase/ private key wasn't correctly written down originally

The seed phrase/private key wasn't written down correctly the first time. In this case, we can't assist you in retrieving your wallet because we don't have access to or save your seed phrase or private key.

### 4. T**he seed phrase is not in the right standard**â€Œ

Coin98 supports 2 import options (New Standard or Old Standard) for each wallet on some blockchains such as Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche C-chain, Viction (formerly Tomochain), Celo, Injective, The Open Network, Tron, Persistence and Aptos (including Aptos Testnet, Aptos Devnet and Aptos mainnet). If you did not choose the right standard that the initial wallet belongs to, it cannot be properly recovered.&#x20;

The default standard on Coin98 upon creating a new wallet/importing an existing wallet is the new one. If you wish to restore using the old standard, you can select it in the advanced options.
