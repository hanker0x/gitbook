## How to import Multi-chain wallets to Coin98 Super Wallet

To import a Multi-chain wallet to Coin98 Super Wallet, you need its Seed phrase. Therefore, you should store the Seed phrase carefully from the moment of creating the wallet.

Seed phrase and Private Key are security keys that can be understood as a type of password in which the Seed phrase consists of 12 random English keywords, while the Private Key consists of a string of letters and numbers. If you want to restore access to your wallets, you must have ownership of the Seed phrases (used for restoring both Single Chain Wallet and Multichain Wallet) or Private Key (only used for restoring Single Chain Wallet).
