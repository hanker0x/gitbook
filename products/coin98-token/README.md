### Platform Service Fees

When using Coin98 Exchange, users are required to pay a small fee for each transaction successfully. This fee is paid using the native C98 token.

### Staking Incentives

For Coin98 Exchange to function well, it is critical to incentivize users to play the role of liquidity providers and stake their digital assets into the decentralized market-making pools. As compensation for opportunity costs, by providing liquidity, or participating in liquidity mining across the various Coin98 staking options and platforms, users can earn a passive income by locking up funds and receiving C98 tokens in return.

### Governance

To promote decentralized community governance for the network, C98 token holders may propose and vote on governance proposals to determine features and/or parameters of the Coin98 Exchange and its products. By participating in the platform’s governance model, users can commit C98 tokens to vote on new features and changes to various protocol parameters throughout the Coin98 crypto network.

For the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of the Coin98 Exchange; the right to vote does not entitle C98 token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, and does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities. The arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership.

### Unique Membership Rights

C98 Token holders are arranged into a tiered system that provides access to exclusive privileges and premium events, based on the amount of C98 held. Users in higher tiers will gain exclusive access to premium events and privileges, such as priority for Coin98 launchpad participation and marketing events with strategic partners.

### Product Development and Growth

Furthermore, the C98 token will be used to create a “self-sustainable, closed-loop economy” through the collection of network fees, whether in C98 or otherwise, would be re-distributed as incentives for active contributors within the ecosystem, or set aside for future product development and ecosystem growth.
