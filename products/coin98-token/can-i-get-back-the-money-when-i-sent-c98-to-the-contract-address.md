# Can I get back the money when I sent C98 to the contract address?

We are extremely sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done from our side to recover those tokens for you and restore your balance.

C98 smart contract has not implemented a function that allows it to transfer received tokens, which means the fund is irretrievable by the owner. Executed transactions on blockchains are irreversible and you should make sure that the receiverâ€™s address is correct before approving the transaction.
