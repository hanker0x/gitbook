### Prepare father tokens for gas fees <a href="#section-11" id="section-11"></a>

Coin98 Vault uses the father tokens of each blockchain as **gas fees,** so you have to have these tokens as fees to claim the tokens.

You can buy the native coins on CEXs like Binance, Kucoin,… and withdraw to the corresponding wallets to experience the product. For layer 2 blockchains like Boba, please convert ETH to the corresponding network to use it.
