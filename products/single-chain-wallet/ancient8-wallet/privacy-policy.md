We will assess and respond to requests to delete personal data and we shall accordingly delete personal data provided that the personal data is no longer required in order to fulfill our business, contractual, legal, regulatory and/or statutory obligations, or the fulfillment of any obligations to preserve records according to applicable laws and regulations.

In general, how long we keep your personal data depends on the nature of the data, e.g. we keep personal data for at least the duration of the limitation period for bringing claims if the personal data may be required to commence or defend legal proceedings. Some information may also be retained for longer e.g. where we are required to do so by law.
