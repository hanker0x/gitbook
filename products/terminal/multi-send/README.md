### Simplicity <a href="#simplicity" id="simplicity"></a>

Ease of use and intuitive user experience flows are two of the significant barriers to mainstream DeFi adoption.

Coin98 Exchange provides a user-friendly interface with plenty of valuable tools such as Multi-send, Token Issuers, and Multi-sig and Revoke are expectedly coming. Users don't need to look for an intermediary; carefully check their trust. From now on, you can access Coin98 Exchange and directly send tokens to the number of addresses you want.

### Convenience & time saving <a href="#convenience_and_time_saving" id="convenience_and_time_saving"></a>

If a user wants to send 10 C98 (BEP20) to address A, 30 C98 to address B, and 5 C98 to address C; they would need to do one transaction at a time and repeat that process. That is just an easy example; how about sending a token to 100 or 1000 addresses?

Coin98 Exchange's multi-send allows users to deploy the transaction in just one time with a flexible amount of tokens, which helps them save time, energy, and money.
