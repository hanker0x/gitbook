# How to use Token Issuer on Coin98 Extension

Token Issuer is a feature that allows users to issue their own tokens easily and conveniently. Currently, Token Issuer is supporting on multi-blockchains such as Ethereum (ERC20), Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), HECO Chain (HRC20), Polygon, Viction, etc.

To issue a new token on Token Issuer, follow steps below:

On the Products navigation bar at the top of the page, select **Coin98 Issuer** or visit the link: [**terminals.coin98.com/issuer**](https://terminals.coin98.com/issuer)

**Step 1:** Connect to the wallet that you wish to issue tokens by selecting the corresponding blockchain and then the wallet address.

**Step 2:** Upload the token's logo and fill in the following information:

* **Name:** The name of the token
* **Symbol:** The symbol of the token in upper case (cannot be more than 5 characters).
* **Total supply:** The total amount of tokens you wish to issue.
* **Decimal Points:** The number of decimal places in the token's unit.

You can consider two options when issuing the token:

* **Token Burn:** This check specifies whether your tokens can be burned to decrease the supply
* **Token Mint:** This check specifies whether your tokens can be created to increase the initial supply.

You can choose or not choose both options but bear in mind that if you don't choose any, your initial aggregate supply will not be allowed to change.

* **Owner Address:** The address receiving the issued tokens. The system will automatically fill in the connected wallet address.

You need to prepare enough fees for this step. If you agree, click **Confirm** on the pop-up confirmation.
