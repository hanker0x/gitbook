# Wallet Approval

## **Why should you use Wallet Approval tool?** <a href="#id-72ey2t569dtb" id="id-72ey2t569dtb"></a>

In order to trade, farm, stake, or interact with any dApps, users are required to allow smart contracts to access your assets. There are 2 approaches to allowance: **Allow for a specific amount of tokens** and **unlimited approval**.

* **Allow for a specific amount of tokens:** Users give access to a particular amount of tokens for smart contracts of DApp. It can not exceed the maximum tokens that you grant.
* **Unlimited approval:** It means that users provide a smart contract with full permission of your funds.

Unlimited approval brings them a fast and frictionless experience; however, it might potentially affect the risk of asset loss if users interact with untrustworthy platforms or scamming pools.

It is recommended not to grant unlimited access to a platform to keep your funds safe.
