<summary>What are the benefits of using Zen Card?</summary>

Zen Card has an innovative operating mechanism that helps increase security and minimize the risk of users' wallets being hacked. With an optimal price and compact size, Zen Card is also a reasonable choice for users. Personalize your experience and increase the security of your assets.

* High security: After encryption, the key is separated into 2 parts, one part is stored on the mobile's secure partition, and the other part is stored on the Zen Card. So even if you lose your Zen Card or lose your Mobile, hackers have no way to decode the original Key, and users can restore their wallet. Every time you need to sign a transaction, the user connects Zen Card to Mobile, at this time Coin98 Super Wallet will set up a Secure & Private environment to synthesize the real-time Key, after signing the transaction, the Key that has just been synthesized will be immediately destroyed. That helps increase security compared to hot wallets.

<summary>Is connecting and trading from Zen Card easier than other wallets?</summary>

<summary>Are there any risks in using Zen Card?</summary>

There are basic risks when operating on blockchain that users can encounter when using any type of wallet:

* Risk of losing wallet if user loses/reveals key. An important thing to note is that, no matter what type of wallet you use, users need to carefully store the wallet's recovery key (Seed Phrase/Private Key). If you lose or reveal your recovery key, whether it's a cold wallet or a Zen Card, you can lose your assets.
* If a user signs a scam contract, they are still at risk of losing their wallet and assets as usual.

Particularly for Zen Card: the risk of users overwriting the existing wallet in Zen Card without saving the recovery key of that wallet. Users should note that each Zen Card can only hold one wallet at a time, any operation to create/restore/transfer a wallet to the Zen Card will replace the previously existing wallet. Therefore, always remember to store your recovery key carefully at the time of wallet creation so that you can restore your Zen wallet to a normal hot wallet in case you no longer want to use it with your Zen Card.

<details>

<summary>If I lose my Zen Card, will I lose my assets?</summary>

In case you lose your Zen card, you can always restore the wallet containing the assets using Seed Phrase and use it as a normal hot wallet. If you have another Zen card, you can continue to migrate this wallet to the new Zen card and use it as before. This means that losing your Zen card does not mean losing your assets. Besides, the Zen card's encryption mechanism will ensure that if your card falls into the hands of strangers, they cannot "hack" your wallet and assets.

An important thing to note is that no matter what type of wallet you use, users need to carefully store the wallet's recovery key (Seed Phrase/Private Key). If you lose or reveal the recovery key, whether it is a cold wallet, hot wallet, or Zen Card, you can lose your assets.
